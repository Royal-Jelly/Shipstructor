# shipstructor
The way players manage thier ship is terrible and not customizable at all, this mod aims to change that.

I sugest not to this on your precious save, bad things can happen as its still in development.


Goals:

(1) Create a framework for players to swap out ships

(2) All vanilla ships and teirs are available to all races at any time

(3) The option for players to create thier own ships froms scratch
